# Hand-Gesture-Recognizer
Currently in Development Phase

In this project, the aim is to develop a robust model to predict hand gestures, and output the result in the form of text,
which can be used for other purposes.


## Dependencies :
      1. TensorFlow
      2. Keras
      3. Numpy
      4. OpenCV
      5. Matplotlib
      
      

## Dataset :
Currently, this model is being trained on my dataset, which is built using OpenCv and webcam.
However, feel free to add your own hand gesture data alongwith the labels. Larger the dataset, better the prediction.
